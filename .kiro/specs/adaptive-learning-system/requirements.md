# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Ollama's Llama 3.2 model to create an adaptive learning system that generates personalized educational content based on user difficulty levels and performance. The system will dynamically create chapters with modules, quizzes, tests, and flashcards, adapting content based on user mistakes and learning patterns to provide targeted review materials.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the system to generate educational chapters based on my selected difficulty level, so that I receive content appropriate to my learning stage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) THEN the system SHALL generate chapters using Ollama Llama 3.2 model
2. WHEN generating chapters THEN the system SHALL create content with appropriate complexity for the selected difficulty
3. WHEN chapters are generated THEN each chapter SHALL contain multiple modules with structured learning content
4. IF the user changes difficulty level THEN the system SHALL regenerate content appropriate to the new level

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learner, I want each chapter to contain organized modules with quizzes, so that I can learn progressively and test my understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chapter is created THEN it SHALL contain at least 3-5 modules with educational content
2. WHEN a module is completed THEN the system SHALL provide a quiz to test comprehension
3. WHEN a quiz is taken THEN the system SHALL track correct and incorrect answers
4. WHEN quiz results are recorded THEN the system SHALL identify knowledge gaps for targeted review

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the system to generate tests and flashcards based on my quiz mistakes, so that I can focus on areas where I need improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes mistakes in quizzes THEN the system SHALL analyze error patterns using Ollama
2. WHEN error patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL generate targeted tests focusing on weak areas
3. WHEN tests are generated THEN the system SHALL create flashcards for concepts the user struggled with
4. WHEN flashcards are created THEN they SHALL include the original concept and simplified explanations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a learner, I want a review system that adapts to my learning progress, so that I can efficiently reinforce my knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes tests and flashcard reviews THEN the system SHALL track improvement metrics
2. WHEN improvement is detected THEN the system SHALL reduce frequency of review for mastered concepts
3. WHEN concepts remain challenging THEN the system SHALL increase review frequency and generate additional practice materials
4. WHEN generating review content THEN the system SHALL use Ollama to create varied question formats and explanations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Ollama integration to be configurable and reliable, so that content generation works consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL establish connection to Ollama Llama 3.2 model
2. WHEN Ollama is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback content or appropriate error messages
3. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL validate Ollama responses for quality and relevance
4. WHEN content generation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with adjusted prompts or use cached content

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a learner, I want my learning progress and generated content to be saved, so that I can continue my studies across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL save chapters, modules, quizzes, and flashcards to the database
2. WHEN a user completes activities THEN the system SHALL persist progress data and performance metrics
3. WHEN a user returns to the system THEN they SHALL be able to resume from their last position
4. WHEN reviewing past content THEN users SHALL access previously generated materials without regeneration
